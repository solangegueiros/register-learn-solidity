## Learn solidity with the Register project

This is a set of smart contracts examples to learn Solidity fundamentals

Register-01.sol is a very basic smart contract.

Then will be created new versions, adding Solidity concepts in each of them.

I suggest to try it in [Remix](http://remix.ethereum.org/)
